## STToolkit for UAV-based live flying tour experiences

The new 5G mobile network allows providing live flying tours for remote tourists with no carbon footprint. 360º aerial vision allows innovative virtual travelers’ experiences, where virtual tourists can interact with the tour guide (UAV pilot) to obtain a detailed information about a particular issue, or even change the flight course.

Flying over touristic attractions intensifies emotions by displaying special views and unusual perspectives. UAV-based travels transmitted live will be much less expensive and will be available for people with disabilities or special needs, who cannot access certain attractions but still want to see them, or for busy people who want to explore new attractions but do not have enough time.
